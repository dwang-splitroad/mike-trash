## Overview
This guide will help you set up email notifications for service signups using SendGrid.

âœ… Beautiful HTML email template with all customer information  
âœ… Verified address included in email  
âœ… Service type clearly displayed

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install SendGrid Package
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

### 2. Get Your SendGrid API Key

1. Go to [SendGrid](https://app.sendgrid.com/)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **API Keys**
4. Click **Create API Key**
5. Give it a name (e.g., "Mikes Trash Website")
6. Select **Full Access** or at minimum **Mail Send** permission
7. Click **Create & View**
8. **Copy the API key immediately** (you won't be able to see it again!)

### 3. Verify Your Sender Email

Before sending emails, you need to verify your sender email address:

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **Verify a Single Sender**
3. Enter your details:
   - From Name: `Mike's Trash Service`
   - From Email: `noreply@mikestrash.com` (or your preferred email)
4. Check your email and click the verification link

**Note:** If you don't own the domain, use a personal email for testing, then switch to a verified domain email later.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# .env.local
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Important:** Never commit this file to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

### 5. Update Sender Email (if needed)

Edit `lib/sendgrid.ts` line 88 to match your verified sender:

```typescript
from: {
  email: 'your-verified-email@yourdomain.com', // Replace with your verified sender
  name: "Mike's Trash Service"
},
```

### 6. Test the Setup

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to any service page (Residential, Dumpsters, etc.)

3. Click "Get Services" and fill out the form:
   - Enter an address
   - Wait for verification
   - Fill in customer details
   - Submit the form

4. Check `dennis@splitroadmedia.com` for the email!

## Files Created

### Core Files:
- `lib/sendgrid.ts` - SendGrid configuration and email template
- `app/api/signup/route.ts` - API endpoint for form submissions
- `components/address-checker.tsx` - Updated with API integration

### Configuration:
- `.env.local.example` - Environment variable template
- `SENDGRID_SETUP.md` - This setup guide

## Troubleshooting

### Email not sending?

1. **Check API Key**: Make sure it's in `.env.local` and starts with `SG.`
2. **Verify Sender**: Ensure your sender email is verified in SendGrid
3. **Check Console**: Look for errors in terminal/browser console
4. **SendGrid Dashboard**: Check Activity â†’ Email Activity for errors

### Common Errors:

**"Forbidden" Error**:
- Your API key doesn't have Mail Send permission
- Create a new API key with proper permissions

**"Sender not verified"**:
- Go to SendGrid Settings â†’ Sender Authentication
- Verify your sender email address

**"Invalid API key"**:
- Check that `.env.local` exists and has the correct key
- Restart your dev server after adding the key

## Testing Recipients

### Current Setup:
- Test emails go to: `dennis@splitroadmedia.com`
- Located in: `lib/sendgrid.ts` line 86

### To Change Recipient:
Edit `lib/sendgrid.ts`:
```typescript
to: 'your-email@example.com', // Line 86
```

### To Add Multiple Recipients:
```typescript
to: ['dennis@splitroadmedia.com', 'another@email.com'],
```

## Production Considerations

### Before Going Live:

1. **Update Recipient Email**:
   - Change from test email to actual business email
   - Add multiple recipients if needed

2. **Domain Verification** (Recommended):
   - Instead of single sender, verify your entire domain
   - This improves deliverability and looks more professional
   - Go to SendGrid â†’ Settings â†’ Sender Authentication â†’ Authenticate Your Domain

3. **Email Templates** (Optional):
   - Create reusable templates in SendGrid dashboard
   - Use template IDs instead of inline HTML

4. **Rate Limits**:
   - Free tier: 100 emails/day
   - Upgrade if you expect more signups

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Check SendGrid dashboard regularly
   - Monitor email delivery rates
   - Set up webhook for bounce notifications
