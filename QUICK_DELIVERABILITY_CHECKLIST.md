## 🔥 TOP 3 PRIORITIES (Do These First)

### 1. VERIFY SPF RECORD EXISTS ⚠️ CRITICAL
I couldn't see your SPF record in DNS. This is the #1 reason for spam.

**Check GoDaddy:**
1. Log into GoDaddy → DNS for `mikestrashllc.com`
2. Look for TXT record with Host = `@`
3. Should say: `v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all`
4. **If missing, ADD IT:**
   - Type: TXT
   - Host: @
   - Value: v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all

**Test it:** https://mxtoolbox.com/spf.aspx (enter `mikestrashllc.com`)

### 2. SET UP LINK BRANDING IN SENDGRID

**Why:** Prevents SendGrid's domain from appearing in your emails.

**How:**
1. SendGrid → Settings → Sender Authentication → **Link Branding**
2. Click "Brand New Link"
3. Domain: `mikestrashllc.com`, Subdomain: `email`
4. Copy the CNAME record SendGrid gives you
5. Add to GoDaddy DNS:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Host: `email`
   - Points to: (value from SendGrid)
6. Click "Verify" in SendGrid

### 3. ASK RECIPIENTS TO WHITELIST

Have Mike and Dennis do this RIGHT NOW:

**Gmail:**
1. Open email from `no-reply@mikestrashllc.com`
2. Click "⋮" → "Add to Contacts"
3. Settings → Filters → "Never send to Spam"

**Outlook:**
1. Right-click email → "Add to Safe Senders"

---

## 📊 TEST YOUR SETUP

**After completing steps 1-3, send a test email to:**
https://www.mail-tester.com/

They'll give you an address. Send an email from your website to that address.

**Goal:** Score 8/10 or higher

**If under 8:** The report will tell you exactly what's wrong.

## ⏰ BUILD REPUTATION SLOWLY

**Week 1:** Send max 50 emails/day
**Week 2:** Send max 100 emails/day  
**Week 3+:** Full volume

New domains are suspicious. Start slow!
